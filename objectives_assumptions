***************
Main Goal
*************
Create an assistive robot that takes care of a person
e.g : elderly person


*******
Main Objective for this research (may be for a single paper)  
***********
Create a robot that can move among a crowd in a human-like manner
for now I am not considering the accompnying person


************
main techniques to use
************
inverse reinforcement learning
Here, we observe how real people move among a crown and try to understand their reward functions
For this research in particular, we can use multi agent inverse reinforcement learning. 
Researchers have done this. 

**************
things which I need to learn
*************
inverse reinforcement learning
multi agent inverse reinforcement learning

*************'
What I have done so far
*************
1. create a simple multi agent reinforcement learnign experiment and 
showed that empathical multi agent reinforcement learning can exist. 
But this is not a regorous proof!

2. 

*************
hypothesis
**************
incorporating empathy into the reinforcement learning will improve the 
human-likeness of the robot motion.

*****************
Assumptions
***************
choose one/many from below:

1. the robot will be operating in an elder-care home ?
2. in a shopping mall which helps a person to shop
3. in a shopping mall/supermarket which helps customers in general (quite different from initial objective)
4. A robot which accompany a person in crowded area. eg. shoping mall, city centre

********************
how to test this hypothesis ?
********************
1. find a dataset of people moving and interacting with each other. 
2. develop a inverse multi agent reinforcement learning algorithm which incorporates
    empathy. I can extend the earlier simpler version.
3. Learn from how the people move. And try to predic their motion
4. compare with the existing result from the literature. 
5. Be happy
